<h1>The Mozart Expositional Punctuation Corpus: A Dataset of Interthematic Cadences in Mozart’s Sonata-Allegro Expositions </h1>

<h2>Appendix: Graphic Visualization </h2>

<h3>Uri B. Rom, Omer Raz, and Dror Chawin </h3>

<h4>The Buchmann-Mehta School of Music, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel </h4>

<p>This graphic visualization complements our dataset deposited on <a href="https://github.com/corpusTAU/The-Mozart-Expositional-Punctuation-Corpus">GitHub</a>.

</p><p>Each horizontal line below represents the timeline of an 
exposition section according to the order of appearance in the dataset, 
and is preceded by information regarding the containing work and 
movement. The number at the extreme left represents the first measure 
number of the exposition (typically, measure 1). The number on the 
extreme right represents the exposition's duration in measures. 

</p><p>The labels correspond to the four closure types discussed in our 
report, inspired by the punctuation system of Heinrich Christoph Koch 
(1782–1793). Timestamps (measure number, beat in subscript) indicate the
 beginning and end of a given closural event, where the beginning stands
 for the cadential arrival, and the end for the end of the postcadential
 space. In case the beginning and end coincide, the end timestamp is 
omitted. Elided cadences are marked with a small letter 'e' following 
the end timestamp. 

</p><p>Adapting Joseph Riepel's (1752–1768) convention of using black 
and white squares, we represent authentic cadences by a full square, and
 half cadences by an empty square. The squares are color-coded, where 
blue indicates the primary key, and red the secondary key (in major: V; 
in minor: III, or, in a single case, v). Insofar as our data allows to 
determine the exposition's tonal areas, the timeline itself is colored 
in a similar manner, leaving unidentified segments grey.
